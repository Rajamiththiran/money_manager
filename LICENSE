Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent
claims the licensor can license, or will be able to license, that you would

Fairness

If the licensor notifies you that you have violated this license, you can keep
all licenses from this licensor if you take all practical steps to come into
compliance within 30 days after the notice. This is the first such notice.
If you do not, your license ends immediately.

No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to
anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else.

violations are excused if you take all practical steps to come into compliance
within 30 days after the notice. If you do not, all your licenses end immediately.
